% Algorithm for filtering in the frequency Domain
% Step1: Given an input image f(x,y) of size M x N, obtain the pading
% parameters P and Q. Typically, we select P = 2M and Q = 2N
% Step2: Form a padded image fp(x,y) of size P X Q by appending the
% necessary number of zeros to f(x,y).
% Step3: Multiply fp(x,y) by (-1)^(x+y) to center its transform
% Step4: Compute the DFT, F(u,v) of the image from Step 3
% Step5: Generate a Real, Symmetric Filter Function H(u,v) of size P X Q
% with center at coordinates (P/2,Q/2), 
% Step 6:Form the product G(u,v) = H(u,v)F(u,v) using array multiplication
% Obtain the processed image 
% Step 7: gp(x,y) = {real{inverse DFT[G(u,v)]}(-1)^(x+y)
